description: Host your own SPV Wallet services

# ðŸŸ¢ Get started

The instructions here are aimed at allowing you to deploy the SPV Wallet as quickly and easily as possible. This requires an AWS account, and a domain name under Route53. If you don't want to use AWS to host your wallet, then the components of SPV Wallet are available as container images, and the [helm charts](https://github.com/BuxOrg/bux-helm/) can be used to create a deployment of your own elsewhere.

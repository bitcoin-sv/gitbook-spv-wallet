# ðŸ’» Fork It

Anyone interested in developing their own wallet can use this as a starting point. **This is not only relevant for developers, but also for governments, enterprises and exchanges.** The alignment of your software with this reference implementation will enable adoption of the latest industry standards, adapting to new BSV infrastructure as the network scales.&#x20;

In order to develop your own applications based on this reference SPV Wallet implementation you'll need to fork the repositories individually. There are two main GitHub links which contain everything:

{% embed url="https://github.com/BuxOrg/" %}
The Org which includes most of the wallet components.
{% endembed %}

{% embed url="https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/pulse" %}
The headers only client.
{% endembed %}

Each component has its own README which will guide you through the setup process. A developer guide on how to get things set up will follow.
